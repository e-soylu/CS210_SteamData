# CS210_SteamData Term Project
This project involves the application of data analysis, data discovery, and machine learning algorithms to examine the games I own on Steam and the associated data related to those games

# Motivation
I embarked on a personal project to
explore and analyze my own Steam data. This project delves into the vast
expanse of my gaming history, employing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
and visualization techniques to unearth meaningful insights

# Data Source
The data for this project originates from my existing Steam account, and I
retrieved the necessary information by generating an API Key through
Steam's 'Steam Web API' (available at https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API).
